# Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

- Setup project using [shadcn.ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next) instructions.
- Reason behind using shadcn : Shadcn installs UI components code inside @components/ui folder which gives us ownership to change variants and other properties related. This feature is not found in other libraries like Material UI or Chakra UI.
